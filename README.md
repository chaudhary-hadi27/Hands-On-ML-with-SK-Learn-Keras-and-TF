# Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow

This repository contains my **personal learning notes, practical code implementations, and insights**
from the book ***"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow (3rd Edition)"***
by *Aurélien Géron*.

It’s a complete hands-on journey to strengthen your **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** fundamentals,
step by step, from classical models to advanced neural networks.

---

## Goals

* Empower you to become a **skilled AI Engineer** and open the gateway to **AI research**.
* Help you understand **how learning systems actually work** — from data to predictions.
* Provide **clean notes, code examples, and educational resources** (documents & videos).

> This is not just code — it’s a structured learning roadmap for aspiring AI scientists.
